               some may even say criminal. But he has a wealth of riches 
               to show for it.

        <h2>Top Cat Morgan Diamond JAILED! Bail Denied!</h2>
        <h3>Arrested for Catnip-Backed Securities Fraud</h3>
        One the same day as Morgan Diamond was named Meow Street's 
        most profitable Fat Cat, the MSPD snapped him up and charged him 
        with Securities Fraud: specifically, Catnip-Backed Securities 
        Fraud. Diamond is alleged to have defrauded investors who poured 
        millions into complex instruments backed by the commodity catnip.
        <br><br>
        Diamond's lawyer, Fluffy Perkins, a partner at Kitty Livy, LLP, 
        stated that "my client, Mr. Diamond, is innocent of all charges. 
        We will fight to clear Mr. Diamond's name and get him back to 
        business."
        <br><br>Mr. Diamond faces up to forty years in prison if 
        convicted.
