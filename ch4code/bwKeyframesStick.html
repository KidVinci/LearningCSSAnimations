		<p>setting <span>animation-fill-mode</span> to <span>forwards</span> will apply the styles defined in the final keyframe to the element after the animation is completed. In this example, that means the final keyframe's setting of the background color to gray is applied even after the animation finishes. The normal behavior is to jump back to how the element was originally styled (in this example, the background color began as black).</p>
